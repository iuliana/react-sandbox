= Chapter 4 : Hooks

The *effect Hook* is used for component side effects. A component side effect is something executed outside the scope of the component, such as a web service request. The effect Hook is defined using the `useEffect` function from React. `useEffect` contains two parameters:

* A function that executes the effect; at a minimum, this function runs each time the component is rendered.
* An optional array of dependencies that cause the effect function to rerun when changed

Rules:

* A Hook can only be called at the top level of a function component. So, a Hook can’t be called in a loop or in a nested function such as an event handler.
* A Hook can’t be called conditionally.
* A Hook can only be used in function components and not class components.
